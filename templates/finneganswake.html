And his two little jiminies, cousins</span><br> <span id = 697>of ourn, Tristopher and Hilary, were kickaheeling their dummy</span><br> <span id = 698>on the oil cloth flure of his homerigh, castle and earthenhouse.</span><br> <span id = 699>And, be dermot, who come to the keep of his inn only the niece-</span><br> <span id = 700>of-his-in-law, the prankquean. And the prankquean pulled a rosy</span><br> <span id = 701>one and made her wit foreninst the dour. And she lit up and fireland</span><br> <span id = 702>was ablaze. And spoke she to the dour in her petty perusienne:</span><br> <span id = 703>Mark the Wans, why do I am alook alike a poss of porterpease?</span><br> <span id = 704>And that was how the skirtmisshes began. But the dour</span><br> <span id = 705>handworded her grace in dootch nossow: Shut! So her grace</span><br> <span id = 706>o'malice kidsnapped up the jiminy Tristopher and into the shandy</span><br> <span id = 707>westerness she rain, rain, rain. And Jarl van Hoother warlessed</span><br> <span id = 708>after her with soft dovesgall: Stop deef stop come back to</span><br> <span id = 709>my earin stop. But she swaradid to him: Unlikelihud. And there</span><br> <span id = 710>was a brannewail that same sabboath night of falling angles somewhere</span><br> <span id = 711>in Erio. And the prankquean went for her forty years'</span><br> <span id = 712>walk in Tourlemonde and she washed the blessings of the lovespots</span><br> <span id = 713>off the jiminy with soap sulliver suddles and she had her</span><br> <span id = 714>four owlers masters for to tauch him his tickles and she convorted</span><br> <span id = 715>him to the onesure allgood and he became a luderman. So then</span><br> <span id = 716>she started to rain and to rain and, be redtom, she was back again</span><br> <span id = 717>at Jarl van Hoother's in a brace of samers and the jiminy with</span><br> <span id = 718>her in her pinafrond, lace at night, at another time. And where</span><br> <span id = 719>did she come but to the bar of his bristolry. And Jarl von Hoother</span><br> <span id = 720>had his baretholobruised heels drowned in his cellarmalt,</span><br> <span id = 721>shaking warm hands with himself and the jimminy Hilary and</span><br> <span id = 722></span><br> <span id = 723>the dummy in their first infancy were below on the tearsheet,</span><br> <span id = 724>wringing and coughing, like brodar and histher. And the prankquean</span><br> <span id = 725>nipped a paly one and lit up again and redcocks flew flackering</span><br> <span id = 726>from the hillcombs. And she made her witter before the</span><br> <span id = 727>wicked, saying: Mark the Twy, why do I am alook alike two poss</span><br> <span id = 728>of porterpease? And: Shut! says the wicked, handwording her</span><br> <span id = 729>madesty. So her madesty a forethought set down a jiminy and</span><br> <span id = 730>took up a jiminy and all the lilipath ways to Woeman's Land she</span><br> <span id = 731>rain, rain, rain. And Jarl von Hoother bleethered atter her with</span><br> <span id = 732>a loud finegale: Stop domb stop come back with my earring stop.</span><br> <span id = 733>But the prankquean swaradid: Am liking it. And there was a wild</span><br> <span id = 734>old grannewwail that laurency night of starshootings somewhere</span><br> <span id = 735>in Erio. And the prankquean went for her forty years' walk in</span><br> <span id = 736>Turnlemeem and she punched the curses of cromcruwell with</span><br> <span id = 737>the nail of a top into the jiminy and she had her four larksical</span><br> <span id = 738>monitrix to touch him his tears and she provorted him to the</span><br> <span id = 739>onecertain allsecure and he became a tristian. So then she started</span><br> <span id = 740>raining, raining, and in a pair of changers, be dom ter, she was</span><br> <span id = 741>back again at Jarl von Hoother's and the Larryhill with her under</span><br> <span id = 742>her abromette. And why would she halt at all if not by the ward</span><br> <span id = 743>of his mansionhome of another nice lace for the third charm?</span><br> <span id = 744>And Jarl von Hoother had his hurricane hips up to his pantrybox,</span><br> <span id = 745>ruminating in his holdfour stomachs (Dare! O dare!), and</span><br> <span id = 746>the jiminy Toughertrees and the dummy were belove on the</span><br> <span id = 747>watercloth, kissing and spitting, and roguing and poghuing, like</span><br> <span id = 748>knavepaltry and naivebride and in their second infancy. And the</span><br> <span id = 749>prankquean picked a blank and lit out and the valleys lay twinkling.</span><br> <span id = 750>And she made her wittest in front of the arkway of trihump,</span><br> <span id = 751>asking: Mark the Tris, why do I am alook alike three poss of porter</span><br> <span id = 752>pease? But that was how the skirtmishes endupped. For like</span><br> <span id = 753>the campbells acoming with a fork lance of lightning, Jarl von</span><br> <span id = 754>Hoother Boanerges himself, the old terror of the dames, came</span><br> <span id = 755>hip hop handihap out through the pikeopened arkway of his</span><br> <span id = 756>three shuttoned castles, in his broadginger hat and his civic chollar</span><br> <span id = 757>and his allabuff hemmed and his bullbraggin soxangloves</span><br> <span id = 758>and his ladbroke breeks and his cattegut bandolair and his furframed</span><br> <span id = 759></span><br> <span id = 760>panuncular cumbottes like a rudd yellan gruebleen orangeman</span><br> <span id = 761>in his violet indigonation, to the whole longth of the</span><br> <span id = 762>strongth of his bowman's bill. And he clopped his rude hand to</span><br> <span id = 763>his eacy hitch and he ordurd and his thick spch spck for her to</span><br> <span id = 764>shut up shop, dappy. And the duppy shot the shutter clup (Per-</span><br> <span id = 765>kodhuskurunbarggruauyagokgorlayorgromgremmitghundhurth-</span><br> <span id = 766>rumathunaradidillifaititillibumullunukkunun!) And they all drank</span><br> <span id = 767>free. For one man in his armour was a fat match always for any</span><br> <span id = 768>girls under shurts. And that was the first peace of illiterative</span><br> <span id = 769>porthery in all the flamend floody flatuous world. How kirssy the</span><br> <span id = 770>tiler made a sweet unclose to the Narwhealian captol. Saw fore</span><br> <span id = 771>shalt thou sea. Betoun ye and be. The prankquean was to hold</span><br> <span id = 772>her dummyship and the jimminies was to keep the peacewave</span><br> <span id = 773>and van Hoother was to git the wind up. Thus the hearsomeness</span><br> <span id = 774>of the burger felicitates the whole of the polis.</span><br> <span id = 775></span><br> <span id = 776>O foenix culprit!

So you see the Mookse he</span><br> <span id = 5989>had reason as I knew and you knew and he knew all along.

And into the river that had been a stream (for a</span><br> <span id = 6007>thousand of tears had gone eon her and come on her and she was</span><br> <span id = 6008>stout and struck on dancing and her muddied name was Missisliffi)</span><br> <span id = 6009>there fell a tear, a singult tear, the loveliest of all tears (I</span><br> <span id = 6010>mean for those crylove fables fans who are 'keen' on the prettypretty</span><br> <span id = 6011>commonface sort of thing you meet by hopeharrods) for it</span><br> <span id = 6012>was a leaptear.

Hock! Ickick gav him that toock, imitator! And it</span><br> <span id = 17133>was entirely theck latter to blame. Does he drink because I am sorely</span><br> <span id = 17134>there shall be no more Kates and Nells. If you see him it took</span><br> <span id = 17135>place there. It was given meeck, thank the Bench, to assist at the</span><br> <span id = 17136>whole thing byck special chancery licence. As often as I think of</span><br> <span id = 17137>that unbloody housewarmer, Shem Skrivenitch, always cutting</span><br> <span id = 17138>my prhose to please his phrase, bogorror, I declare I get the</span><br> <span id = 17139>jawache! Be me punting his reflection he'd begin his beogrefright</span><br> <span id = 17140>in muddyass ribalds. Digteter! Grundtsagar! Swop beef!</span><br> <span id = 17141>You know he's peculiar, that eggschicker, with the smell of old</span><br> <span id = 17142>woman off him, to suck nothing of his switchedupes. M.D. made</span><br> <span id = 17143>his ante mortem for him. He was grey at three, like sygnus the</span><br> <span id = 17144>swan, when he made his boo to the public and barnacled up to the</span><br> <span id = 17145>eyes when he repented after seven. The alum that winters on his</span><br> <span id = 17146>top is the stale of the staun that will soar when he stambles till</span><br> <span id = 17147>that hag of the coombe rapes the pad off his lock. He was down</span><br> <span id = 17148>with the whooping laugh at the age of the loss of reason the</span><br> <span id = 17149>whopping first time he prediseased me. He's weird, I tell you, and</span><br> <span id = 17150>middayevil down to his vegetable soul. Never mind his falls</span><br> <span id = 17151>feet and his tanbark complexion. That's why he was forbidden</span><br> <span id = 17152>tomate and was warmed off the ricecourse of marrimoney, under</span><br> <span id = 17153>the Helpless Corpses Enactment. I'm not at all surprised the saint</span><br> <span id = 17154>kicked him whereby the sum taken Berkeley showed the reason</span><br> <span id = 17155>genrously. Negas, negasti—negertop, negertoe, negertoby, negrunter!</span><br> <span id = 17156>Then he was pusched out of Thingamuddy's school</span><br> <span id = 17157>by Miss Garterd, for itching. Then he caught the europicolas and</span><br> <span id = 17158>went into the society of jewses. With Bro Cahlls and Fran Czeschs</span><br> <span id = 17159></span><br> <span id = 17160>and Bruda Pszths and Brat Slavos. One temp when he foiled to</span><br> <span id = 17161>be killed, the freak wanted to put his bilingual head intentionally</span><br> <span id = 17162>through the Ikish Tames and go and join the clericy as a demonican</span><br> <span id = 17163>skyterrier. Throwing dust in the eyes of the Hooley Fermers!</span><br> <span id = 17164>He used to be avowdeed as he ought to be vitandist. For</span><br> <span id = 17165>onced I squeaked by twyst I'll squelch him. Then he went to</span><br> <span id = 17166>Cecilia's treat on his solo to pick up Galen. Asbestopoulos! Inkupot!</span><br> <span id = 17167>He has encaust in the blood. Shim! I have the outmost contempt</span><br> <span id = 17168>for. Prost bitten! Conshy!

'Tis</span><br> <span id = 17190>pebils before Sweeney's as he swigged a slug of Jon Jacobsen</span><br> <span id = 17191>from his treestem sucker cane. Mildbut likesome!

Upu now!</span><br> <span id = 17210></span><br> <span id = 17211>—Undoubtedly but that is show, Shaun replied, the muttermelk</span><br> <span id = 17212>of his blood donor beginning to work, and while innocent</span><br> <span id = 17213>of disseminating the foul emanation, it would be a fall day I</span><br> <span id = 17214>could not, sole, so you can keep your space and by the power of</span><br> <span id = 17215>blurry wards I am loyable to do it (I am convicted of it!) any time</span><br> <span id = 17216>ever I liked (bet ye fippence off me boot allowance!) with the</span><br> <span id = 17217>allergrossest transfusiasm as, you see, while I can soroquise the</span><br> <span id = 17218>Siamanish better than most, it is an openear secret, be it said,</span><br> <span id = 17219>how I am extremely ingenuous at the clerking even with my</span><br> <span id = 17220>badily left and, arrah go braz, I'd pinsel it with immenuensoes</span><br> <span id = 17221>as easy as I'd perorate a chickerow of beans for the price of two</span><br> <span id = 17222>maricles and my trifolium librotto, the authordux Book of Lief,</span><br> <span id = 17223>would, if given to daylight, (I hold a most incredible faith about</span><br> <span id = 17224>it) far exceed what that bogus bolshy of a shame, my soamheis</span><br> <span id = 17225>brother, Gaoy Fecks, is conversant with in audible black and</span><br> <span id = 17226>prink.

He is considered to have committed,</span><br> <span id = 23219>invoking droit d'oreiller, simple infidelities with Felicia, a virgin,</span><br> <span id = 23220>and to be practising for unnatural coits with Eugenius and Jeremias,</span><br> <span id = 23221>two or three philadelphians. Honophrius, Felicia, Eugenius</span><br> <span id = 23222>and Jeremias are consanguineous to the lowest degree. Anita</span><br> <span id = 23223>the wife of Honophrius, has been told by her tirewoman, Fortissa,</span><br> <span id = 23224>that Honuphrius has blasphemously confessed under voluntary</span><br> <span id = 23225>chastisement that he has instructed his slave, Mauritius, to</span><br> <span id = 23226>urge Magravius, a commercial, emulous of Honuphrius, to solicit</span><br> <span id = 23227>the chastity of Anita. Anita is informed by some illegitimate</span><br> <span id = 23228>children of Fortissa with Mauritius (the supposition is Ware's)</span><br> <span id = 23229>that Gillia, the schismatical wife of Magravius, is visited clandestinely</span><br> <span id = 23230>by Barnabas, the advocate of Honuphrius, an immoral</span><br> <span id = 23231>person who has been corrupted by Jeremias. Gillia, (a cooler</span><br> <span id = 23232>blend, D'Alton insists) ex equo with Poppea, Arancita, Clara,</span><br> <span id = 23233></span><br> <span id = 23234>Marinuzza, Indra and Iodina, has been tenderly debauched</span><br> <span id = 23235>(in Halliday's view), by Honuphrius, and Magravius knows</span><br> <span id = 23236>from spies that Anita has formerly committed double sacrilege</span><br> <span id = 23237>with Michael, vulgo Cerularius, a perpetual curate, who wishes</span><br> <span id = 23238>to seduce Eugenius. Magravius threatens to have Anita molested</span><br> <span id = 23239>by Sulla, an orthodox savage (and leader of a band of twelve</span><br> <span id = 23240>mercenaries, the Sullivani), who desires to procure Felicia for</span><br> <span id = 23241>Gregorius, Leo, Vitellius and Macdugalius, four excavators, if</span><br> <span id = 23242>she will not yield to him and also deceive Honuphrius by rendering</span><br> <span id = 23243>conjugal duty when demanded. Anita who claims to have</span><br> <span id = 23244>discovered incestuous temptations from Jeremias and Eugenius</span><br> <span id = 23245>would yield to the lewdness of Honuphrius to appease the</span><br> <span id = 23246>savagery of Sulla and the mercernariness of the twelve Sullivani,</span><br> <span id = 23247>and (as Gilbert at first suggested), to save the virginity of</span><br> <span id = 23248>Felicia for Magravius when converted by Michael after the</span><br> <span id = 23249>death of Gillia, but she fears that, by allowing his marital rights</span><br> <span id = 23250>she may cause reprehensible conduct between Eugenius and</span><br> <span id = 23251>Jeremias. Michael, who has formerly debauched Anita, dispenses</span><br> <span id = 23252>her from yielding to Honuphrius who pretends publicly to</span><br> <span id = 23253>possess his conjunct in thirtynine several manners (turpiter!</span><br> <span id = 23254>affirm ex cathedris Gerontes Cambronses) for carnal hygiene</span><br> <span id = 23255>whenever he has rendered himself impotent to consummate by</span><br> <span id = 23256>subdolence. Anita is disturbed but Michael comminates that</span><br> <span id = 23257>he will reserve her case tomorrow for the ordinary Guglielmus</span><br> <span id = 23258>even if she should practise a pious fraud during affrication</span><br> <span id = 23259>which, from experience, she knows (according to Wadding),</span><br> <span id = 23260>to be leading to nullity. Fortissa, however, is encouraged by</span><br> <span id = 23261>Gregorius, Leo, Viteilius, and Magdugalius, reunitedly, to warn</span><br> <span id = 23262>Anita by describing the strong chastisements of Honuphrius</span><br> <span id = 23263>and the depravities (turpissimas!) of Canicula, the deceased wife</span><br> <span id = 23264>of Mauritius, with Sulla, the simoniac, who is abnegand and</span><br> <span id = 23265>repents. Has he hegemony and shall she submit?</span><br> <span id = 23266></span><br> <span id = 23267>Translate a lax, you breed a bradaun. In the goods of Cape and</span><br> <span id = 23268>Chattertone, deceased.</span><br> <span id = 23269></span><br> <span id = 23270>This, lay readers and gentilemen, is perhaps the commonest</span><br> <span id = 23271>of all cases arising out of umbrella history in connection with</span><br> <span id = 23272></span><br> <span id = 23273>the wood industries in our courts of litigation. D'Oyly Owens</span><br> <span id = 23274>holds (though Finn Magnusson of himself holds also) that so</span><br> <span id = 23275>long as there is a joint deposit account in the two names a</span><br> <span id = 23276>mutual obligation is posited. Owens cites Brerfuchs and Warren,</span><br> <span id = 23277>a foreign firm, since disseized, registered as Tangos, Limited,</span><br> <span id = 23278>for the sale of certain proprietary articles. The action which was</span><br> <span id = 23279>at the instance of the trustee of the heathen church emergency</span><br> <span id = 23280>fund, suing by its trustee, a resigned civil servant, for the payment</span><br> <span id = 23281>of tithes due was heard by Judge Doyle and also by a common</span><br> <span id = 23282>jury. No question arose as to the debt for which vouchers</span><br> <span id = 23283>spoke volumes. The defence alleged that payment had been made</span><br> <span id = 23284>effective. The fund trustee, one Jucundus Fecundus Xero Pecundus</span><br> <span id = 23285>Coppercheap, counterclaimed that payment was invalid</span><br> <span id = 23286>having been tendered to creditor under cover of a crossed cheque,</span><br> <span id = 23287>signed in the ordinary course, in the name of Wieldhelm, Hurls</span><br> <span id = 23288>Cross, voucher copy provided, and drawn by the senior partner</span><br> <span id = 23289>only by whom the lodgment of the species had been effected but</span><br> <span id = 23290>in their joint names. The bank particularised, the national misery</span><br> <span id = 23291>(now almost entirely in the hands of the four chief bondholders</span><br> <span id = 23292>for value in Tangos), declined to pay the draft, though there</span><br> <span id = 23293>were ample reserves to meet the liability, whereupon the trusty</span><br> <span id = 23294>Coppercheap negociated it for and on behalf of the fund of the</span><br> <span id = 23295>thing to a client of his, a notary, from whom, on consideration, he</span><br> <span id = 23296>received in exchange legal relief as between trusthee and bethrust,</span><br> <span id = 23297>with thanks. Since then the cheque, a good washable pink, embossed</span><br> <span id = 23298>D you D No 11 hundred and thirty 2, good for the figure</span><br> <span id = 23299>and face, had been circulating in the country for over thirtynine</span><br> <span id = 23300>years among holders of Pango stock, a rival concern, though not</span><br> <span id = 23301>one demonetised farthing had ever spun or fluctuated across the</span><br> <span id = 23302>counter in the semblance of hard coin or liquid cash. The jury (a</span><br> <span id = 23303>sour dozen of stout fellows all of whom were curiously named</span><br> <span id = 23304>after doyles) naturally disagreed jointly and severally, and the</span><br> <span id = 23305>belligerent judge, disagreeing with the allied jurors' disagreement,</span><br> <span id = 23306>went outside his jurisfiction altogether and ordered a garnishee</span><br> <span id = 23307>attachment to the neutral firm. No mandamus could locate</span><br> <span id = 23308>the depleted whilom Breyfawkes as he had entered into an</span><br> <span id = 23309></span><br> <span id = 23310>ancient moratorium, dating back to the times of the early barters,</span><br> <span id = 23311>and only the junior partner Barren could be found, who entered an</span><br> <span id = 23312>appearance and turned up, upon a notice of motion and after service</span><br> <span id = 23313>of the motion by interlocutory injunction, among the male jurors</span><br> <span id = 23314>to be an absolete turfwoman, originally from the proletarian class,</span><br> <span id = 23315>with still a good title to her sexname of Ann Doyle, 2 Coppinger's</span><br> <span id = 23316>Cottages, the Doyle's country. Doyle (Ann), add woman in,</span><br> <span id = 23317>having regretfully left the juryboxers, protested cheerfully on the</span><br> <span id = 23318>stand in a long jurymiad in re corset checks, delivered in doylish,</span><br> <span id = 23319>that she had often, in supply to brusk demands rising almost</span><br> <span id = 23320>to bollion point, discounted Mr Brakeforth's first of all in exchange</span><br> <span id = 23321>at nine months from date without issue and, to be strictly</span><br> <span id = 23322>literal, unbottled in corrubberation a current account of how</span><br> <span id = 23323>she had been made at sight for services rendered the payeedrawee</span><br> <span id = 23324>of unwashable blank assignations, sometimes pinkwilliams</span><br> <span id = 23325>(laughter) but more often of the crème-de-citron, vair émail paoncoque</span><br> <span id = 23326>or marshmallow series, which she, as bearer, used to endorse,</span><br> <span id = 23327>adhesively, to her various payers-drawers who in most cases</span><br> <span id = 23328>were identified by the timber papers as wellknown tetigists of the</span><br> <span id = 23329>city and suburban. The witness, at her own request, asked if she</span><br> <span id = 23330>might and wrought something between the sheets of music paper</span><br> <span id = 23331>which she had accompanied herself with for the occasion and</span><br> <span id = 23332>this having been handed up for the bench to look at in camera,</span><br> <span id = 23333>Coppinger's doll, as she was called, (annias, Mack Erse's Dar,</span><br> <span id = 23334>the adopted child) then proposed to jerrykin and jureens and every</span><br> <span id = 23335>jim, jock and jarry in that little green courtinghousie for her satis-</span><br> <span id = 23336>faction and as a whole act of settlement to reamalgamate herself,</span><br> <span id = 23337>tomorrow perforce, in pardonership with the permanent suing fond</span><br> <span id = 23338>trustee, Monsignore Pepigi, under the new style of Will Breakfast</span><br> <span id = 23339>and Sparrem, as, when all his cognisances had been estreated,</span><br> <span id = 23340>he seemed to proffer the steadiest interest towards her, but this</span><br> <span id = 23341>prepoposal was ruled out on appeal by Judge Jeremy Doyler, who,</span><br> <span id = 23342>reserving judgment in a matter of courts and reversing the findings</span><br> <span id = 23343>of the lower correctional, found, beyond doubt of treuson,</span><br> <span id = 23344>fending the dissassents of the pickpackpanel, twelve as upright</span><br> <span id = 23345>judaces as ever let down their thoms, and, occupante extremum</span><br> <span id = 23346>scabie, handed down to the jury of the Liffey that, as a matter of</span><br> <span id = 23347>tact, the woman they gave as free was born into contractual incapacity</span><br> <span id = 23348>(the Calif of Man v the Eaudelusk Company) when, how</span><br> <span id = 23349>and where mamy's mancipium act did not apply and therefore held</span><br> <span id = 23350>supremely that, as no property in law can exist in a corpse,</span><br> <span id = 23351>(Hal Kilbride v Una Bellina) Pepigi's pact was pure piffle (loud</span><br> <span id = 23352>laughter) and Wharrem would whistle for the rhino.

And the fiercest freaky ever</span><br> <span id = 25263>followed a pining child round the sluppery table with a forkful</span><br> <span id = 25264>of fat. But a king of whistlers. Scieoula! When he'd prop me atlas</span><br> <span id = 25265>against his goose and light our two candles for our singers duohs</span><br> <span id = 25266>on the sewingmachine. I'm sure he squirted juice in his eyes to</span><br> <span id = 25267>make them flash for flightening me. Still and all he was awful</span><br> <span id = 25268>fond to me. Who'll search for Find Me Colours now on the hillydroops</span><br> <span id = 25269>of Vikloefells? But I read in Tobecontinued's tale that while</span><br> <span id = 25270>blubles blows there'll still be sealskers. There'll be others but non</span><br> <span id = 25271>so for me. Yed he never knew we seen us before. Night after</span><br> <span id = 25272>night. So that I longed to go to. And still with all. One time you'd</span><br> <span id = 25273>stand fornenst me, fairly laughing, in your bark and tan billows of</span><br> <span id = 25274>branches for to fan me coolly. And I'd lie as quiet as a moss. And</span><br> <span id = 25275>one time you'd rush upon me, darkly roaring, like a great black</span><br> <span id = 25276>shadow with a sheeny stare to perce me rawly. And I'd frozen</span><br> <span id = 25277>up and pray for thawe. Three times in all. I was the pet of everyone</span><br> <span id = 25278>then. A princeable girl. And you were the pantymammy's Vulking</span><br> <span id = 25279>Corsergoth. The invision of Indelond. And, by Thorror, you</span><br> <span id = 25280>looked it! My lips went livid for from the joy of fear. Like almost</span><br> <span id = 25281>now. How? How you said how you'd give me the keys of me</span><br> <span id = 25282>heart. And we'd be married till delth to uspart. And though dev</span><br> <span id = 25283>do espart. O mine! Only, no, now it's me who's got to give. As</span><br> <span id = 25284>duv herself div.

But you're changing, acoolsha, you're changing</span><br> <span id = 25287>from me, I can feel. Or is it me is? I'm getting mixed. Brightening</span><br> <span id = 25288></span><br> <span id = 25289>up and tightening down. Yes, you're changing, sonhusband, and</span><br> <span id = 25290>you're turning, I can feel you, for a daughterwife from the hills</span><br> <span id = 25291>again. Imlamaya. And she is coming. Swimming in my hindmoist.</span><br> <span id = 25292>Diveltaking on me tail. Just a whisk brisk sly spry spink spank</span><br> <span id = 25293>sprint of a thing theresomere, saultering. Saltarella come to her</span><br> <span id = 25294>own. I pity your oldself I was used to. Now a younger's there.</span><br> <span id = 25295>Try not to part! Be happy, dear ones! May I be wrong! For she'll</span><br> <span id = 25296>be sweet for you as I was sweet when I came down out of me</span><br> <span id = 25297>mother. My great blue bedroom, the air so quiet, scarce a cloud.</span><br> <span id = 25298>In peace and silence. I could have stayed up there for always only.</span><br> <span id = 25299>It's something fails us. First we feel. Then we fall. And let her rain</span><br> <span id = 25300>now if she likes. Gently or strongly as she likes. Anyway let her</span><br> <span id = 25301>rain for my time is come. I done me best when I was let. Thinking</span><br> <span id = 25302>always if I go all goes. A hundred cares, a tithe of troubles and</span><br> <span id = 25303>is there one who understands me? One in a thousand of years of</span><br> <span id = 25304>the nights? All me life I have been lived among them but now</span><br> <span id = 25305>they are becoming lothed to me. And I am lothing their little</span><br> <span id = 25306>warm tricks. And lothing their mean cosy turns. And all the</span><br> <span id = 25307>greedy gushes out through their small souls. And all the lazy</span><br> <span id = 25308>leaks down over their brash bodies. How small it's all! And me</span><br> <span id = 25309>letting on to meself always. And lilting on all the time. I thought</span><br> <span id = 25310>you were all glittering with the noblest of carriage. You're only</span><br> <span id = 25311>a bumpkin. I thought you the great in all things, in guilt and in</span><br> <span id = 25312>glory. You're but a puny. Home! My people were not their sort</span><br> <span id = 25313>out beyond there so far as I can. For all the bold and bad and</span><br> <span id = 25314>bleary they are blamed, the seahags. No! Nor for all our wild</span><br> <span id = 25315>dances in all their wild din. I can seen meself among them, allaniuvia</span><br> <span id = 25316>pulchrabelled. How she was handsome, the wild Amazia,</span><br> <span id = 25317>when she would seize to my other breast! And what is she weird,</span><br> <span id = 25318>haughty Niluna, that she will snatch from my ownest hair! For</span><br> <span id = 25319>'tis they are the stormies. Ho hang! Hang ho! And the clash of</span><br> <span id = 25320>our cries till we spring to be free. Auravoles, they says, never heed</span><br> <span id = 25321>of your name! But I'm loothing them that's here and all I lothe.</span><br> <span id = 25322>Loonely in me loneness. For all their faults. I am passing out. O</span><br> <span id = 25323>bitter ending! I'll slip away before they're up. They'll never see.</span><br> <span id = 25324>Nor know. Nor miss me. And it's old and old it's sad and old it's</span><br> <span id = 25325></span><br> <span id = 25326>sad and weary I go back to you, my cold father, my cold mad</span><br> <span id = 25327>father, my cold mad feary father, till the near sight of the mere</span><br> <span id = 25328>size of him, the moyles and moyles of it, moananoaning, makes me</span><br> <span id = 25329>seasilt saltsick and I rush, my only, into your arms. I see them</span><br> <span id = 25330>rising! Save me from those therrble prongs! Two more. Onetwo</span><br> <span id = 25331>moremens more. So. Avelaval. My leaves have drifted from me.</span><br> <span id = 25332>All. But one clings still. I'll bear it on me. To remind me of. Lff!</span><br> <span id = 25333>So soft this morning, ours. Yes. Carry me along, taddy, like you</span><br> <span id = 25334>done through the toy fair! If I seen him bearing down on me now</span><br> <span id = 25335>under whitespread wings like he'd come from Arkangels, I sink</span><br> <span id = 25336>I'd die down over his feet, humbly dumbly, only to washup. Yes,</span><br> <span id = 25337>tid. There's where. First. We pass through grass behush the bush</span><br> <span id = 25338>to. Whish! A gull. Gulls. Far calls. Coming, far! End here.
